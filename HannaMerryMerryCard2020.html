				<p >Merry Merry Everyone!</p>
				<p >We hope you've had a wonderful year. Ours has been cheery and not a second of silence. Here's our year in review.</p>
				<ul class="color">
					<li>Silas Ott Hanna was born in time for dinner on Sept. 14th. His name means "third" and "youngest". He's adorebs and the whole family loves his presences and he softens us in ways we never knew more could.</li>
					<li>We bought a car and a trailer and we're officially those people with a trailer in the driveway. Hopefully we'll officially be those people that get out and see the world soon as the weather gets nicer. We did take it on a test drive with G-pa in October and everything went great!</li>
					<li>Erin has been taking classes and teaching online to students from New Orleans to New York. She was WAY ahead of the curve before the pandemic. Zoom Zoomer.</li>
					<li>Jennings got a smoker last year for xmas and has learned how to use it over the course of the year. And made some kind neighbors happy with his brisket. He's not sure he knows what he's doing but it taste good and he's sticking to it so perseverance wins the day right?</li>
					<li>Quiller this year has mastered the puzzle. He recently put one together upside down. Then was like "don't mention it. I was just bored with the picture." Suave and smart.</li>
					<li>Rider is following his namesake as he's now burst onto the San Jose scooter scene! Most everyone stops to ask how old he is as his jet packs ignite and takes off down the sidewalk. He's a fireball, a flamethrowing two year old, and a super sweetie.</li>
				</ul>
				<p >Welp that's the family report for 2020 holidays. We sure do hope to see each and every one of you in 2020.</p>
				<p>All of our love,</p>
				<p>Jennings, Erin, Quiller, Rider, and Silas</p>
