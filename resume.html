				<h5>Editor-In-Chief, Editorial Strategist</h5>
				<p>Electronic Arts</p>
				<small>Today</small>
				<p class="color">
				My role helps our marketing and development studios to create more content with more interaction. I act as a liaison between the newsroom, community engagement teams, and the technical teams that deliver the games. My achievements include support in launching and live services of multiple AAA titles, designing large scale efficiencies across EA websites and editorial, and spearheading partnerships with Google, Twitch, and creative agencies.

				<h5>Interaction Designer</h5>
				<p>Freelance</p>
				<small>2016</small>
				<p class="color">
				For several different startups and clients I was contracted to help with interaction design projects. Including a product for Prudential Life Insurance for loved ones to share stories, a digital scoreboard technology for high school gyms, a advertising creation and reporting tool used by the NYTs (later acquired by Snapchat), and a urban planning cartography product with Calthorpe Analytics, a premiere urban planning firm.

				<p class="color">
				Our team of three built a financial wellness tool as open source software. Organizations interested in learning more about the financial wellness of those they enlist can use it freely. It is deployed as a survey and the results are presented in a aggregate form of visualized data. The product assist businesses and organizations in knowing what benefits they should offer to help people be financially grounded.

			<div class="one-half column">
				<h5>Senior Features Designer</h5>
				<p>NFL Media</p>
				<small>2014</small>
				<p class="color">
				At the NFL I helped build editorial and digital projects for one season. Projects I contributed to include a digital feature called Journeys (Telly Award 2015), NFL UP (Webby and Emmy nominations 2015), a Super Bowl bracket interactive that is still in rotation on both SuperBowl.com and NFL.com, and a partnership with Google and YouTube on the NFL digital video strategy.

				<h5>UX Design Co-op</h5>
				<p>New York City Subways</p>
				<small>2012</small>
				<p class="color">
				As part of the team tasked with overhauling the entire enterprise asset allocation for a agency of over one-hundred thousand employees I applied user experience guidance. My role was mostly building relationships with stakeholders in hopes of them sharing their desires across a slew of RFPs being sent to outside vendors. We did so by use of surveys, interviews, brainstorms, workshops, and detailed documenting and synthesis.

				<h5>Designer</h5>
				<p>T.Moss Design</p>
				<small>2006</small>
				<p class="color">
				As one half of a two person design firm I strategized, designed, and coded websites. Planned out, print designed, and press checked huge catalogs. And made countless other things when clients requested them. Eager to design for a living, I came to understand the way to be successful was to gain clients relationships and trust. Success came fast&mdash; we went from a garage to a nice office downtown in just a few years.
