As Etsy was going public and changing it's corporate status to a B-Corp (which delegates they report emissions and environmental impact to it's board and shareholders) it was important for the company to gather insights and iterate early stage ideas for users to reduce their carbon footprint. That's what I worked on with many teams including the product, research, and data teams. I also worked with and received input from the VP of Values and Impact and his group.</p>

				<p class="color">Etsy is a wonderfully interesting new kind of company. It’s one that is fundamentally attached to the people that use their services. In fact, they’re nothing more than a middle man. What makes Easy special is the passion for the people that use their service. And as a testament to that, they’ve become the first publicly traded B-Corp. What’s more interesting is that they encourage failure and give an award to the developer that takes the site down most in a month. They compost everything in their office very delicately. And once a week have employees bike it to a local rooftop farm.</p>

				<p class="color">Etsy is successfully driving home a small, hand-made market online and making champions out of full-time makers and kitchen table businesses alike.</p>

				<p class="color">The models we have for moving goods though are stagnant. It’s the usual players in transportation: trucks, trains, boats, and airplanes. All of which run predominantly off some kind of oil combustion. Which, just happens to be the largest contributor to Etsy’s carbon footprint. In that case any online stores carbon footprint. It’s almost obvious with the growth of platforms like Amazon that we’re more and more attached to having things shipped to us with the invention of the internet. The ease of online commerce has nearly shut the doors of every major independent bookstore in Manhattan. Within a mere decade and a half. This thirst isn’t going anywhere soon and shipping is getting faster and more efficient. Building on this knowledge we focused on ideas that would generate more awareness for the users of the platform.</p>

				<p class="color">While working on my thesis I helped outlined solutions for Etsy asking “how might we extend the carbon footprint awareness as part of the buyer or seller experience in order to fulfill our B-Corp emissions goals?” In doing this I primarily focused on the experience through the lens of bringing users together to build stronger local networks and informing shoppers of things like rareness, distance, and added cost of goods or production. Each solution is described below.</p>
				
				<img src="assets/images/etsy-score.png" alt="Etsy Carbon Score Idea" />

				<p class="color">A shipping carbon score:</p>

				<p class="color">The first concept is simply an indication of a carbon score on the checkout page. Measuring from 1-10, bad to good. Based on how far a product would have to be shipped and how it might be shipped. Etsy told me that anything traveling over 400 miles is most likely going to catch a ride on a airplane, and airplanes are some of largest emissions polluters per parcel.</p>

				<p class="color">This idea has a core flaw: which is that it would mostly detract users from following through with the purchase, or, in other words, hang them up at the most important gateway, the payment confirmation. No online store wants to impede efficiency at the point of sale.</p>

				<p class="color">Etsy’s feedback was that this could be useful as a modal. Say if there were a slider that the user could move from 1-10 that would change the shipping options as it moved. Very much making it more of a delightful engagement than something that makes a customer feel guilty about buying something they truly admire and want.</p>
				
				<img src="assets/images/etsy-sourcemap.png" alt="Etsy and SourceMap" />

				<p class="color">Source Map Integration</p>

				<p class="color">There is a great online application called SourceMap where anyone can go and set up a map of their supply chain. In this idea I propose Etsy build a feature where the seller can share their SourceMap supply chain transparently with the Etsy community. SourceMap automatically does loose calculations of the carbon cost of the type of material, the distance it will have to travel, and the type of travel. The end result would be a possible exchange about increasing your SourceMap efficiency and possibly getting credits towards shipping for this reduction.</p>

				<p class="color">I should point out that there is already an initiative at Etsy that’s working with sellers to provide complete transparency in where they get their materials, the processes they use, and even the staffing of their operations. Since most sellers are individuals or small shops this is pretty simple and upfront information. But, as those sellers products scale, more of them morph into actual multi-employee small businesses. Having details about these businesses and how to optimize their supply chain could have a huge impact on Etsy’s B-Corp goals.</p>

				<p class="color">Etsys feedback was that this is a bigfish strategy and that many of the sellers on the platform (something like 40%) are soul proprietor businesses. They agreed though that having a tool for sellers to transparently follow resources cost could inspire better decision making. This would be a valuable assumption to test.</p>

				<img src="assets/images/etsy-shop-local.png" alt="Etsy Shop Local" />

				<p class="color">Shop Local Search</p>

				<p class="color">One of the concepts, a local seller search function is available on the Easy prototypes page. It allows you to search out your location, then provides you with a list of events that local Etsy sellers frequent. It’s more of an event finder in that it shows things like farmers markets. For instance, when I searched for my address in New York it brought up the infamous Brooklyn Flea (a huge flea market in Williamsburg every month) and sadly the listing only had a few vendors even at that potential exposure. The reason being though because the tool is a prototype and the sellers have to apply it to their page. It’s only in beta so hopefully as sellers discover this it will find its way to the Etsy platform.</p>

				<img src="assets/images/etsy-shop-local-search.png" alt="Etsy Shop Local Search" />

				<p class="color">In the use case above I am showing a search for hats, then the ability to see the products that could be bought locally. I also thought of this as a potential navigation element that would benefit the user by giving them foresight of the kinds of products you might find around your location. Kind of the reverse of the search, like a sorting function for products nearest to you.</p>

				<p class="color">Etsy’s response to this idea was positive. They were aware of the “event finder” prototype and thought of it as a nice validation. The primary concerns were that the high profile events were usually only regularly found in major cities and that sellers in smaller markets would be at a disadvantage. The other concern was that only larger quantity sellers also sold at markets and that those sellers could again put their smaller market colleagues at a disadvantage.</p>

				<p class="color">Shipping Alternatives: The following concepts focus solely on the shipping components of the Etsy platform.</p>

				<p class="color">Lockers</p>

				<p class="color">The concept is mostly one we thought of and critiqued instead of built upon. It’s really focused on ease of use for the consumer and not any sort of environmental impact. The locker concept was created by Amazon and has been semi-successful in bigger urban areas but its success has been limited to that. Also, it does little or nothing to reduce carbon cost since the product is still being shipped to the locker. And if you really think about it, the buyer now has to take two trips to get the order out of the locker, one could argue that it cost slightly more in carbon emissions.</p>

				<p class="color">Partner Stores</p>

				<p class="color">Partner stores are an excellent example where the frameworks for building them already exist. It would simply take the wholesale platform for stores like West Elm and allow customers to pick up the product there. Though this still has the same issues as the lockers which is that it neither reduces cost from seller to store and again could add cost with the buyer making a round trip. Also, it adds a disadvantage to the small sellers as disussed above due to supply and demand quotas.</p>

				<p class="color">Sharing The Box</p>

				<p class="color">This concept is a desperate attempt at a shipping method that would have a real world application yet help reverse the shipping emissions cost. The idea is that the buyer would enter a queue and once the cue was fulfilled near them the package would be sent. Etsy would then inform all the buyers where and to whom the package is being sent. One specified buyer would receive the package and the other buyers would be instructed to that buyers home to pick up their packages. Lastly, the buyer would have the option to set a length of time before the shared shipping would be dismissed and the product would be shipped in a traditional method.</p>

				<p class="color">Here is a diagram I created to assist in explaining the sharing the box interaction:</p>

				<img src="assets/images/etsy-share-delivery.png" alt="Etsy Sharing the Box Idea" />

				<p class="color">Etsy saw this as a triple win: the package has 3-5 times as much stuff in it — making for at least two less packages, less packaging, and less shipping cost to all parties. Of course there were some concerns about timeliness of deliveries (which has actually been a nagging problem of their platform and the #1 complaint over the years) and the legalities around asking customers to hold packages as a sort of small distribution center. I imagine though if it’s an opt-in solution that might be mitigated.</p>

				<p class="color">Meet in Person</p>

				<p class="color">This is the final prototype and one that Etsy was excited the most about. I am not sure but it may be in the works. I hope so!</p>

				<p class="color">The concept is to use the buyers and sellers location to identify when they live close. When they do provide a link to the “Meet in Person” option shown above. A message would be sent to the seller that a buyer is open to meeting in person. For the seller this engagement can lead to social capital and potentially meeting champion customer. Or possibly another seller that’s buying. (Since a extraordinary percentage of Etsy seller are also buyers) this could be an opportunity to incubate community engagement and encourage collaborations. You never know when you might need something reupholstered or screen printed...</p>

				<p class="color">At the heart of this idea is that Easy would partner with a coffee shop or the like and offer discounts for sellers and buyers meeting in person. This aligns with the B-Corp goals and the focus of bringing people together. The buyer saves the entire cost of shipping and, as a bonus, meets the creator(s). Easy agreed that this solution provided both a complete reduction of carbon on the shipping and buyer side (other than the transportation to the coffee shop). The only limitation acknowledged was that the feature would only work well in areas of high density. Though the benefits definitely outweigh any risk of this causing a disadvantage.</p>

				<p class="color">Here is detailed diagram I created to assist in explaining the meet in person interaction:</p>

				<p class="color">Conclusion</p>

				<p class="color">This was a fantastic exercise for me to sharpen my focus on carbon issues and shipping. It also helped me understand more fluidly some of the user needs of an online shopping platform from both the buyer and seller perspective. As we continue to feel safer about buying things online the shipping cost will continue to increase in expense of both carbon and money. Solutions to help a digital commerce community deal with shipping are hard to create due to the limitations of processing the transaction of two strangers that could be possibly thousands of miles away. As Etsy continues with its mission I am excited to see how the platform sets the pace for the rest of the online commerce industry. I have no doubt after spending time there and speaking with so many of their teams that they are well on their way to doing just that.</p>
